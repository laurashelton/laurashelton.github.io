				<h4 style="float:right;"> Hi! My name is Laura Shelton, and I am currently a Senior at Pace Academy. I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. I have no siblings, but I have a Havaneese puppy named Flash. When I am not at school you can probably find me watching Netflix, at the mall, or working out. I love traveling, photography and all things related to design. At Pace I was the Varisty Softball captain, was on the National Honors Society, won the Varsity Letter Blanket Award, and participated in Advanced Studio Art my Senior year. Contact me if you have any questions! </h4>
